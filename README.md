### Project Description:
The Order Management System will handle product orders from customers and manage the order processing. Customers can place orders, and the system will handle the order's processing, updating the system's state in real-time.

## Here are the main components:

# Order Service:
 This is a RESTful service built using Spring Boot, where customers can create orders, update them, or cancel them.

# Inventory Service: 
 This is another RESTful service that represents your inventory system. This service can deduct products as orders come in, restock products, etc.

# Kafka Messaging System: 
 The Order Service and Inventory Service communicate asynchronously using Kafka.

## Setup:

# Setup Apache Kafka
You can download and install Apache Kafka on your local system. Instructions for setting up Kafka can be found in the official Apache Kafka documentation.

# Create/Clone Spring Boot Applications
Create two separate Spring Boot applications for Order Service and Inventory Service.
You can use the Spring Initializer to create the projects with needed dependencies. For this project, include "Spring Web", "Spring for Apache Kafka", and "Spring Data JPA" for both applications.

# Implement the Order Service
This service should expose endpoints to create, update, and cancel orders.
When an order is created, the service should send a message to a Kafka topic named orders.
Implement the Inventory Service

This service should listen for messages on the orders topic.
Based on the order details, the Inventory Service should update its state (deduct the ordered product from inventory, for example).
If an action is successful, the service should send a message to a Kafka topic named inventory.

# Further Enhancement
Order Service listens to the inventory topic to update the status of the order based on the inventory operation's success or failure.
Implement exception handling for any issues related to Kafka message processing.
Add database support for your services using Spring Data JPA.
Introduce new features, such as email notification for order confirmation.
